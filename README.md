# HOODLY clothing brand website 

This project is a responsive single-page clothing brand website for HOODLY.

## Concept
The website uses one HTML file and dynamically switches between a product list view and a product details view using JavaScript. This approach mimics modern brand websites without page reloads.

## Files
- index.html: Structure and views
- style.css: Styling, layout, and responsiveness
- script.js: Product data and navigation logic
- README.md: Documentation

## Features
- Transparent navigation bar
- Best sellers section with discounts
- Single-page product details view
- Multiple image frames per product
- Working cart with localStorage
- Responsive nude and elegant design

## Customization
- Images with real product photos from Pinterest
- Add more products inside the products object in script.js
- Adjust colors and fonts in style.css

## Usage
Open index.html in a browser to view the website.
No backend or build tools are required.
