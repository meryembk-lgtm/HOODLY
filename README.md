# HOODLY - Premium Clothing Brand Website

This project is a high-end, responsive single-page landing page for the clothing brand "HOODLY", focusing on a minimalist and elegant user experience.

## Concept
The website is designed as a sophisticated single-page interface. It utilizes modern CSS for a premium "nude" aesthetic and JavaScript to handle interactive elements like dynamic cart updates and a modal-based checkout system. This ensures a seamless flow where the user can browse, add to cart, and review their selection without ever leaving the page.

## Files
- index.html: Contains the site structure, product gallery, and the hidden checkout modal.
- style.css: Manages the elegant color palette, custom animations (bumps and fades), and fully responsive grid layouts.
- script.js: Handles the shopping cart state, real-time UI updates, and the logic for the popup notifications and modal.
- README.md: Project documentation and overview.

## Features
- Elegant Navigation: A sticky, minimalist navigation bar featuring a dynamic cart counter.
- Interactive Shop: A curated product gallery with hover effects and instant "Added!" visual feedback.
- Checkout Modal: A professional, blurred-background popup that allows users to review their cart and see total costs instantly.
- Smooth Notifications: Custom toast notifications provide sleek confirmation when items are added.
- Responsive Design: Meticulously styled for a perfect experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- Persistent Logic: A robust cart system that tracks quantities and manages item removal dynamically.

## Customization
- Product Data: Easily update titles and prices within the HTML gallery section.
- Brand Colors: Adjust the primary accent (#d68c7a) and background (#fff5f3) in the CSS global styles to change the brand identity.
- Typography: Uses Playfair Display for headings to maintain a luxury fashion feel.

## Usage
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No external dependencies, compilers, or backend servers are required.
